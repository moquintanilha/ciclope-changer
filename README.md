## Develop Guide
The most important premise of this project is to be a continuous beta, so your contribution is very welcome.

**Branch Strategy**
In our project we chose to use the Gitlab **Flow strategy**, with a change in the name of the pre-production (staging) and production (main) branches.

It is worth remembering that this model is not written in stone, and suggestions are welcome.
